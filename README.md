# WDRMetAnalysis
Analyse raw hourly data and provides useful outputs for understanding of wind driven rain effects

THe output largely considers correlation of wind and rain events.

At some stage (next project) I would like to write in a code section that considers the diameter of raindrops (based on rainfall rate)
and calculates their terminal velocty so the code is then able to output WDR rainfall rate at a particular angle.
